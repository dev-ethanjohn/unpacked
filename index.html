    <div class="scroll-section">
      <h3>Premium Scrollable Section</h3>
      <p>This independent scrolling container has its own refined fade effect. Notice how the text gently appears as
        you scroll down within this section, while the main page's fade effect remains active in the background.</p>
      <p>The gradient fade uses multiple color stops to create a smoother transition from transparent to fully visible
        content. This creates a more natural visual effect than a simple two-stop gradient.</p>
      <p>Custom scrollbar styling complements the color scheme, with a vibrant gradient thumb that matches the heading
        accents. The scrollbar track is subtly transparent to maintain the clean aesthetic.</p>
      <p>Content within this section is carefully spaced for optimal readability. Paragraphs have appropriate
        line-height and margin values to create a comfortable reading rhythm.</p>
      <p>The container features a light border combined with soft shadow for depth, creating visual separation from
        the main content while maintaining an elegant, modern appearance.</p>
      <p>As you reach the bottom of this scrollable section, notice the symmetrical fade effect that gently hides
        content as it approaches the bottom edge, mirroring the top fade effect.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="regular-content">
      <h2>Additional Main Content</h2>
      <p>The main page fade effect continues to work seamlessly as you scroll through different content sections. This
        creates a consistent visual language throughout the entire page.</p>
      <p>Each content block has subtle hover effects that provide gentle feedback when interacting with the page.
        These micro-interactions enhance the user experience without being distracting.</p>
      <p>The typography uses a clean, modern sans-serif stack with careful attention to hierarchy. Heading accents and
        divider lines create visual interest while maintaining professionalism.</p>
      <p>Color choices follow a harmonious palette with blue and purple accents against a light background. The
        content areas use pure white for maximum readability and contrast.</p>
      <p>Padding and spacing values are defined using CSS variables for easy maintenance and consistency across the
        entire layout. This systematic approach ensures visual harmony.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scroll-section">
      <h3>Secondary Scrollable Content</h3>
      <p>This second scrollable container demonstrates how the fade effects work consistently across multiple
        instances. Each scrollable section maintains its independent scrolling behavior while respecting the overall
        page fade.</p>
      <p>The fade effect parameters are controlled by CSS variables, making it easy to adjust the intensity of the
        effect across the entire site by modifying just a few values.</p>
      <p>Notice how the scrollbar styling remains consistent between scrollable sections, creating a cohesive
        experience. The gradient thumb provides a colorful accent while remaining functional.</p>
      <p>Content within these sections can include various elements - paragraphs, lists, or even simple widgets. The
        fade effect works regardless of the content type.</p>
      <p>The smooth transition between transparent and opaque content helps guide the user's attention and creates a
        polished, premium feel to the interface.</p>
      <p>This implementation works across modern browsers while gracefully degrading on older ones. The fade effects
        are purely visual enhancements that don't affect functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="regular-content">
      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>This enhanced version demonstrates how subtle visual effects can significantly improve user experience. The
        double fade effect creates depth and hierarchy while maintaining excellent readability.</p>
      <p>By combining CSS masking with thoughtful design choices, we've created an interface that feels modern and
        polished. The effects are noticeable enough to be appreciated but subtle enough to not distract from the
        content.</p>
      <p>All visual effects are implemented with performance in mind, using efficient CSS properties that don't
        trigger expensive browser repaints during scrolling.</p>
